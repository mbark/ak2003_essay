The aim of this essay is to find an answer to the following question:
\textit{Who is morally responsible for an autonomous car?}
In order to do so, some distinctions have to be done.

First of all, when an entity is referred to as being morally responsible for an
autonomous car it means that the the entity is responsible for the morally
significant actions performed by the car. This definition follows the one
defined by Eshleman in~\cite{eshleman_2014_moral_mra} who further illustrate
what that entails by writing the following:
``Thus, to be morally responsible for something, say an action, is to be
worthy of a particular kind of reaction --- praise, blame, or something akin to
these --- for having performed it.''

When the term responsibility is used it is always according to the definition
above and none of many other possible interpretations (see for
example~\cite[Ch.2]{vincent_2011_moral_mr}). It is especially important to note
that outcome responsibility --- i.e. being responsible for the outcome of a
scenario --- does not necessarily imply moral responsibility. A manufacturer
might be considered responsible for the outcome of a crash involving one of its
self-driving cars, but that does not necessarily mean that they are also morally
responsible.

Throughout the report the term autonomous car is used to describe a fully
autonomous car which requires nothing from the passenger at all. The actions of
the car are therefore the consequence of decisions made by the car without the
possibility for any external input.

The car is considered not to be an moral agents; without specifying the criteria
for what it means to be a moral agent it seems unlikely that the autonomous cars
coming out in the coming years will fulfill even the most basic of criteria. As
such, the possibility is not taken into account in the analysis.

Finally, the introduction of autonomous cars is considered to be good
and something to strive for. It is assumed that traffic accidents will decrease
and that there will be a positive gain from introducing the cars. This is not
yet proven to be true~\cite{schoettle_2015_preliminary_apaorcisv}, but discussing
the case where they are worse than human drivers is considerably less
interesting (see~\cite{marchant_2012_coming_ccbavatlst} for further motivation).
