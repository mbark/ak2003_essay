  abstract = {A number of companies including Google and BMW are currently working on the development of autonomous cars. But if fully autonomous cars are going to drive on our roads, it must be decided who is to be held responsible in case of accidents. This involves not only legal questions, but also moral ones. The first question discussed is whether we should try to design the tort liability for car manufacturers in a way that will help along the development and improvement of autonomous vehicles. In particular, Patrick Lin’s concern that any security gain derived from the introduction of autonomous cars would constitute a trade-off in human lives will be addressed. The second question is whether it would be morally permissible to impose liability on the user based on a duty to pay attention to the road and traffic and to intervene when necessary to avoid accidents. Doubts about the moral legitimacy of such a scheme are based on the notion that it is a form of defamation if a person is held to blame for causing the death of another by his inattention if he never had a real chance to intervene. Therefore, the legitimacy of such an approach would depend on the user having an actual chance to do so. The last option discussed in this paper is a system in which a person using an autonomous vehicle has no duty (and possibly no way) of interfering, but is still held (financially, not criminally) responsible for possible accidents. Two ways of doing so are discussed, but only one is judged morally feasible.},

  abstract = {The trolley problem is a thought experiment in ethics. The general form of the problem is this: There is a runaway trolley barreling down the railway tracks. Ahead, on the tracks, there are five people tied up and unable to move. The trolley is headed straight for them. You are standing some distance off in the train yard, next to a lever. If you pull this lever, the trolley will switch to a different set of tracks. However, you notice that there is one person on the side track. You have two options: (1) Do nothing, and the trolley kills the five people on the main track. (2) Pull the lever, diverting the trolley onto the side track where it will kill one person. Which is the correct choice?

The problem was first introduced by Philippa Foot in 1967, but also extensively analysed by Judith Thomson, Peter Unger, and Frances Kamm as recently as 1996, and has also been revisited in 2015 (Larman and Oates). The German Hans Welzel discussed a similar problem as early as 1951. Outside of the domain of traditional philosophical discussion, the trolley problem has been a significant feature in the fields of cognitive science and, more recently, of neuroethics. It has also been a topic in popular books dealing with human psychology.},

  url = {http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2014/entries/moral-responsibility/},
  abstract = {When a person performs or fails to perform a morally significantaction, we sometimes think that a particular kind of response iswarranted. Praise and blame are perhaps the most obvious forms thisreaction might take. For example, one who encounters a car accidentmay be regarded as worthy of praise for having saved a child frominside the burning car, or alternatively, one may be regarded asworthy of blame for not having used one's mobile phone to callfor help. To regard such agents as worthy of one of these reactions isto regard them as responsible for what they havedone or left undone. (These are examples of other-directed ascriptionsof responsibility. The reaction might also be self-directed, e.g., onecan recognize oneself to be blameworthy). Thus, to be morallyresponsible for something, say an action, is to be worthy of aparticular kind of reaction—praise, blame, or something akinto these—for having performed it.[1] , Though further elaboration and qualification of the abovecharacterization of moral responsibility is called for and will beprovided below, this is enough to distinguish concern about this formof responsibility from some others commonly referred to through use ofthe terms ‘responsibility’ or ‘responsible.’To illustrate, we might say that higher than normal rainfall in thespring is responsible for an increase in the amount of vegetation orthat it is the judge's responsibility to give instructions to the jurybefore they begin deliberating. In the first case, we mean to identifya causal connection between the earlier amount of rain and the laterincreased vegetation. In the second, we mean to say that when oneassumes the role of judge, certain duties, or obligations, follow.Although these concepts are connected with the concept of moralresponsibility discussed here, they are not the same, for in neither case are wedirectly concerned about whether it would be appropriate to react tosome candidate (here, the rainfall or a particular judge) withsomething like praise or blame.[2], Philosophical reflection on moral responsibility has a long history.One reason for this persistent interest is the way the topic seemsconnected with our conception of ourselves as ‘persons.’[3] Many have held that one distinct feature of persons is their status as morallyresponsible agents, a status resting—some have proposed—on a special kind ofcontrol that only they can exercise.  Many who view persons in this wayhave wondered whether their special status is threatened if certainother claims about our universe are true. For example, can a person bemorally responsible for her behavior if that behavior can be explainedsolely by reference to physical states of the universe and the lawsgoverning changes in those physical states, or solely by reference tothe existence of a sovereign God who guides the world along a divinelyordained path?  Concerns of this sort have often motivated reflection on moral responsibility., A comprehensive theory of moral responsibility would elucidate thefollowing: (1) the concept, or idea, of moral responsibility itself;(2) the criteria for being a moral agent, i.e., one who qualifiesgenerally as an agent open to responsibility ascriptions (e.g., onlybeings possessing the general capacity to evaluate reasons for actingcan be moral agents); (3) the conditions under which the concept ofmoral responsibility is properly applied, i.e., those conditions underwhich a moral agent is responsible for a particular something (e.g., amoral agent can be responsible for an action she has performed only ifshe performed it freely, where acting freely entails the ability tohave done otherwise at the time of action); and finally 4) possibleobjects of responsibility ascriptions (e.g., actions, omissions,consequences, character traits, etc.). Although each of these will betouched upon in the discussion below (see, e.g., the brief sketch ofAristotle's account in the next section), the primary focus of thisentry is on the first component—i.e., the concept of moralresponsibility. The section immediately following this introduction isa discussion of the origin and history of Western reflection on moralresponsibility. This is followed by an overview of recent work on theconcept of moral responsibility. For further discussion of issuesassociated with moral responsibility, see the related entriesbelow.},
